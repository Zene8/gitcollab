# Interest of content
I like the pasta page, and that was the main one I remembered, the other wasn't bad though just mhmmm pasta ðŸ¤¤. 8.5/10 just bc one of the pages was not interesting
# Consistency and quality of visual presentation
Mostly good except from wilfred's page, which deviates from the style set in previous pages 6/10
# Quality of written presentation
loved the navbar and about me and pasta page, healthcare page was good to, just needed a centered image. the other page needs to copy the styling of those two pages to remain consistant 8/10
# Validity of HTML
The navbar logo should link back to home, and the navbar on wilfred's page doesn't work and the earch bar sends you to a error. 5/10
# Evidence of collaboration including
20 commits from bfng72, 8 from Oheers, and 6 from khush, however in general they commited the same ammount(lines) of code 10/10
# Author info not written by author
Considering how there isn't much in the about the author section there isn't much to go off. Using the insight page, it appears as if all the about info is writen by one person, but there are also multiple commits to the index page so there is collaboration 10/10
# Balanced contributions from members
bfng does appear to do more but based on the balance ammount of code, im gonna say its balanced.
