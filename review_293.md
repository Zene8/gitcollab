There is a lack of interesting content. Khush however made some interesting points about the positive contributions of computing to healthcare. Rather a large amount of clickbait.
The design is mostly consistent except for Wilfred's page which has a complete lack of design.
Written presentation is ok.
The html is pretty valid.
There is clear equal contributions from each of the three members to this html webpage.

rating: 2/5 (Khush Carry)
